# sspfg

sspfg stands for "Super Simple Platformer Fighting Game" because I am not very creative. 

On that note, CC0 says I don't have to give credit, but I want to anyway. All the icons are not drawn by me. The music is also not made by me. The LICENSE for all of the media and artwork is in `/assets`. I am using these assets as per that license.

On that note, the code is licensed with MIT
