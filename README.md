# sspfg

sspfg stands for "Super Simple Platformer Fighting Game" because I am not very creative. On that note, all the icons are not drawn by me. The music is also not made by me. The LICENSE for all of the media and artwork is in `/assets`

hopefully i finish this. There is currently no animation for attacks on the sprite sheet so uh might be cooked ðŸ’€. Thats a problem for later though
